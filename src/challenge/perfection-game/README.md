## Perfection Game

I was asked to implement this game in interview. It was expected to implement in an hour or so.

There are amount of ways to solve this question. 
You could find what I did in interview(in first commit).

Some thoughts:

If I am working with React, we will think about how to create several components, like Board, Hole, Shape. But when I'm working with valina JS, OOP concept is not applied in my work.  

OOP and Keep in mind SOLID principles.
